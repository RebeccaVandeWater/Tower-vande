# Welcome to Tower!

This social media application allows users to create and interact with events. Users are able to create, edit, and cancel their own events, and create tickets for their events and other users' events! 
Users are also able to create a conversation about an event via a comment section that belongs with each event. They can create, edit, and delete these comments.
Tower's features were tested via Postman tests that ensured that each user's data was interacted with in the applications intended manner.

Tower was the midterm application for CodeWorks, a software engineering bootcamp. I had a little less than one week to create Tower, and show what I understood about data relationships and HTTP requests on the back-end, and creating a user-friendly experience on the front-end.
